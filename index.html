<h1> Hello Fruits lovers 🖐️ </h1> 
<P> Fruits are of different kind and of different health benefit. 
    Fruits are the seed-bearing structures of flowering plants,
     crucial for reproduction and vital for human health, offering vitamins, 
     fiber, and antioxidants, and are botanically diverse (like tomatoes, nuts)
      but commonly known as sweet, fleshy foods (apples, berries) that aid digestion, 
      boost immunity, and reduce disease risk, coming in categories like simple (cherries), 
      aggregate (raspberries), and multiple (pineapples). Join me as i put you through the benefit of some fruits.
